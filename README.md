# Predictive-Modeling-of-Wave-Heights
Introduction to the Wave Height Prediction Project

Wave height forecasting is essential for numerous maritime activities, ranging from the safety of port operations and navigation to marine resource management and the preservation of coastal ecosystems. This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating wave heights based on oceanographic, climatic, and geophysical data. These predictions provide crucial information to reduce risks associated with maritime activities and support proactive coastal planning in response to changing ocean conditions.

The predictive model relies on advanced machine learning techniques applied to chronological data (time series) collected from buoys, satellites, or other oceanic sensors. These data include variables such as wind speed and direction, sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, and historical measurements of wave heights. The modeling process involves several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: This step involves analyzing, cleaning, and preparing the data to eliminate missing values, handle anomalies, and normalize variables, ensuring the data is ready for machine learning.

Feature Selection: From the available data, relevant features are selected to identify the most influential parameters affecting wave height, reducing model complexity while maximizing accuracy.

Model Development and Training: Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests, recurrent neural networks) are tested to identify the most effective approach. The model is then trained on a training dataset and validated on test data to assess its generalization ability.

Model Evaluation and Optimization: The model's performance is measured using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (RÂ²). Adjustments are made to optimize the model, considering potential biases and the natural variability of oceanic conditions.

Through this approach, the project aims to provide a precise and reliable tool for predicting wave heights over short periods, contributing to maritime safety and a better understanding of ocean dynamics.
